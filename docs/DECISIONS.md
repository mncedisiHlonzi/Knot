## KNOT-ADR-001 — Clean-room start; `as-told-by` is out of scope

- **Decision ID:** KNOT-ADR-001
- **Status:** Accepted

**Context:** An earlier prototype at `~/Projects/as-told-by` existed before the current
Knot architecture and product direction were established.

**Decision:** Knot starts as a completely fresh, clean-room project. The `as-told-by`
project is legacy and explicitly out of scope. No code, database schema, migrations, UI,
dependencies, configuration, or architecture from `as-told-by` will be adopted,
refactored, migrated, copied, or treated as an architectural reference.

**Reason:** The current Knot Master Project Brief is the authoritative direction. A
clean-room implementation protects architectural discipline.

**Consequences:** `as-told-by` is out of scope. No Knot task depends on it. KNOT-000a is
cancelled. The roadmap proceeds directly to KNOT-001.
