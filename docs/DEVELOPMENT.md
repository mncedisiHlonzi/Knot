# Knot — Development

How to set up and run the Knot foundation locally.

## Prerequisites

| Tool           | Local machine      | CI      | Notes                                           |
| -------------- | ------------------ | ------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Node.js        | 24                 | 20      | Mobile tooling and package manager              |
| npm            | Bundled with Node.js | (from Node.js) | The only package manager used          |
| Go             | 1.27               | 1.22    | Backend; `backend/go/go.mod` declares `go 1.22`  |
| Docker Desktop | Any recent version | n/a     | Local PostgreSQL + Redis only (Docker Compose)  |
| Git            | Any recent version | n/a     | Version control                                 |
| actionlint     | Optional           | 1.7.7   | Lints `.github/workflows/`; pinned in CI        |

Docker is required **only** for local PostgreSQL and Redis. The mobile app and the Go
backend always run on the host — there is deliberately no application container.

### Version drift — read this before trusting the pins

Local tool versions and CI tool versions are **not** identical today:

- **Node:** local development runs **Node 24**; CI pins **Node 20**.
- **Go:** local development runs **Go 1.27**; `backend/go/go.mod` declares `go 1.22` and
  CI installs **Go 1.22**.

This drift is accepted for the foundation phase, but it means a green local run is **not**
proof that CI will be green.

> **The first CI run is the true test of the pins.** If a pin is wrong, CI is what fails —
> correct the pin rather than lowering the local toolchain.

## Local infrastructure (PostgreSQL + Redis)

Local PostgreSQL and Redis run in Docker via
`infrastructure/docker/docker-compose.yml`. That file contains **no application
service** — the mobile app and the Go backend run on the host and reach the containers
over `localhost`.

- Images are pinned to specific minor versions (`postgres:16.4-alpine`,
  `redis:7.4.0-alpine`). `latest` is never used.
- Ports bind to `127.0.0.1` only, so nothing is exposed to your network.
- Data lives in the named volumes `knot_postgres_data` and `knot_redis_data`.
- The CI "Services smoke" job uses the **same pinned versions**, so local and CI do not
  drift apart.

### Developer scripts

| Script                 | What it does                                                       |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `scripts/dev-up.sh`    | Start PostgreSQL + Redis. Idempotent — safe to re-run.              |
| `scripts/dev-down.sh`  | Stop them. **Named volumes are preserved**, so data survives.       |
| `scripts/dev-reset.sh` | Stop them and **delete** the named volumes. Destructive.            |

```bash
scripts/dev-up.sh             # start Postgres + Redis
scripts/dev-down.sh           # stop, keep data
scripts/dev-reset.sh          # wipe all local data — prompts for confirmation
scripts/dev-reset.sh --yes    # wipe all local data without a prompt
```

`dev-reset.sh` is destructive: it requires the literal word `yes`, or the `--yes` flag.
All three scripts drive Docker Compose only — they never touch mobile or Go source, and
they exit with a clear message if the Docker CLI is unavailable.

To drive Compose directly instead:

```bash
docker compose -f infrastructure/docker/docker-compose.yml --env-file .env up -d
docker compose -f infrastructure/docker/docker-compose.yml --env-file .env down
docker compose -f infrastructure/docker/docker-compose.yml config   # syntax check only
```

## Mobile (`apps/mobile/`)

```bash
cd apps/mobile
npm install
npm run lint        # ESLint
npm run typecheck   # tsc --noEmit (strict)
npm test            # Jest
npm run format:check # Prettier
```

There is intentionally no runnable product app yet — the scaffold has no navigation and
no product screens.

## Backend (`backend/go/`)

```bash
cd backend/go
gofmt -l .          # should print nothing
go vet ./...
go test ./...
go run ./cmd/knot   # prints a single startup line
```

The binary loads configuration and prints a single startup line. It opens **no**
connection to PostgreSQL or Redis, has no HTTP server, and has no database or cache
driver.

## Backend configuration

`backend/go/internal/config` reads configuration from the environment. It uses the Go
standard library only and it stores the Postgres DSN and Redis address **without
connecting to either**.

| Variable            | Required                 | Notes                                  |
| ------------------- | ------------------------ | -------------------------------------- |
| `KNOT_ENV`          | No — defaults to `local` | `local`, `ci`, or `test`               |
| `KNOT_POSTGRES_DSN` | Only when `ci` / `test`  | Has a safe local default               |
| `KNOT_REDIS_ADDR`   | Only when `ci` / `test`  | Has a safe local default               |

- `local` (or unset): missing values fall back to the safe local defaults listed in
  `.env.example`.
- `ci` / `test`: both variables are **required**; the backend fails fast and names every
  missing one.
- Any other value: treated as required as well, so an unrecognised environment never
  silently receives local defaults.

```bash
cd backend/go
KNOT_ENV=local go run ./cmd/knot   # knot-backend 0.1.0 starting (env=local)
KNOT_ENV=ci go run ./cmd/knot      # fails fast: KNOT_POSTGRES_DSN, KNOT_REDIS_ADDR
```

Only the environment name is ever printed. The DSN and Redis address may carry
credentials and are never logged.

## Environment configuration

- All expected environment variable names live in `.env.example` at the repository root.
- **Convention:** names and placeholder values only. Real secrets are **never** committed.
- Copy `.env.example` to `.env` locally and fill in real values.
- **`.env` is git-ignored; `.env.example` is tracked.** `.gitignore` ignores `.env` and
  `.env.*`, then re-allows `!.env.example`. You can confirm both facts at any time:

```bash
git check-ignore -v .env          # should report a matching ignore rule
git ls-files --error-unmatch .env.example   # should succeed (file is tracked)
```

- The active variables are the `KNOT_*` ones:
  - `KNOT_ENV`, `KNOT_POSTGRES_DSN`, `KNOT_REDIS_ADDR` — read by the Go backend.
  - `KNOT_POSTGRES_USER`, `KNOT_POSTGRES_PASSWORD`, `KNOT_POSTGRES_DB`,
    `KNOT_POSTGRES_PORT`, `KNOT_REDIS_PORT` — consumed by
    `infrastructure/docker/docker-compose.yml`.
- The "reserved for later phases" block (`DATABASE_URL`, `REDIS_URL`, `JWT_SECRET`) is
  placeholder-only and **not used yet**.

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

## npm install scripts (recorded from KNOT-001)

During the KNOT-001 verification run, `npm ci` in `apps/mobile/` **skipped the install
scripts** of some transitive dependencies. Two were observed explicitly:

- `@parcel/watcher` (2.6.0)
- `unrs-resolver` (1.12.2)

Both are present in `apps/mobile/package-lock.json`. They ship optional native binaries,
so a skipped install script can leave a missing or stale native binding on some machines.
In KNOT-001 the skips did **not** affect `lint`, `typecheck`, or `test`.

Practical guidance:

- A skipped install script is not automatically a failure — confirm the behaviour still
  works before changing anything.
- If a later task starts depending on file-watching or module-resolution performance,
  re-check whether these scripts need to run, and whether npm's install-script policy
  (its allow-list / `allowScripts` behaviour) is what is blocking them.
- Do not add `--ignore-scripts`, or change the install-script policy, without an approved
  task.

## Formatting and linting conventions

- **Prettier** formats the mobile app (see `apps/mobile/.prettierrc.json`).
- **ESLint** (flat config) lints the mobile app; TypeScript strict mode is on.
- **gofmt** is the single source of truth for Go formatting.
- `.editorconfig` defines shared whitespace rules (2 spaces; tabs for Go files).

## Continuous integration

`.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs on every push and pull request. It has four jobs:

- **Mobile job:** install → lint → type-check → test.
- **Backend job:** gofmt check → `go vet` → `go test`.
- **Workflows job:** `actionlint`, pinned to `v1.7.7`, lints `.github/workflows/`. It is
  installed from source with `go install`, so no third-party action has to be trusted and
  the version never floats.
- **Services smoke job:** starts PostgreSQL and Redis with GitHub Actions `services:`
  using the **same pinned image versions as** `infrastructure/docker/docker-compose.yml`,
  then proves reachability with `psql` (`SELECT 1;`) and `redis-cli ping`. It creates
  **no schema, no migrations, and no product tables**.

There are **no deployment steps**. CI verifies the foundation only.
