# Knot — API

**Status: MVP, subject to change.** These endpoints exist to get the first people onto
Knot. Shapes, codes, and paths may change without notice while the product is in
foundation and early Phase 1.

- Base URL: `http://localhost:8080` (see `KNOT_HTTP_PORT` and `KNOT_API_URL`).
- All request and response bodies are JSON, sent with `Content-Type: application/json`.
- Request bodies are limited to **1 MiB**. Unknown fields are **rejected**.
- Every request is logged with a request id. Send `X-Request-ID` to correlate your own
  logs; the server echoes it back, and generates one when it is absent.

## Errors

Every error uses the same envelope:

```json
{ "error": { "code": "invalid_credentials", "message": "invalid credentials" } }
```

`code` is stable and safe to branch on. `message` is human-readable and may change.

| Status | `code`              | Meaning                                              |
| ------ | ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| 400    | `validation_error`  | A field failed validation; `message` names the field  |
| 400    | `invalid_request`   | Body is not a single valid JSON object, or has unknown fields |
| 401    | `invalid_credentials` | Login failed. Deliberately identical for a wrong password and an unknown email |
| 405    | *(empty body)*      | Method not allowed for that path                     |
| 409    | `email_taken`       | That email is already registered                     |
| 413    | `request_too_large` | Body exceeded 1 MiB                                  |
| 500    | `internal_error`    | Something failed server-side. No internal detail is returned |

## GET /health

Liveness only. It touches no dependency, so it answers "is this process serving HTTP",
not "is the database healthy".

**200**

```json
{ "status": "ok", "version": "0.1.0", "time": "2026-10-07T16:26:36Z" }
```

`time` is RFC3339 in UTC.

## POST /auth/register

Creates an account and returns a token pair.

**Request**

```json
{
  "email": "ada@example.com",
  "password": "at-least-8-characters",
  "display_name": "Ada Lovelace",
  "preferred_languages": ["en", "fr"],
  "approximate_location": "Cape Town",
  "phone": "+27000000000"
}
```

| Field                  | Required | Rules                                                          |
| ---------------------- | -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `email`                | yes      | Valid address, at most 254 characters, stored lower-cased        |
| `password`             | yes      | At least 8 characters, at most 1024 bytes                        |
| `display_name`         | yes      | 1-80 characters after trimming                                   |
| `preferred_languages`  | no       | At most 20 entries, each at most 35 characters; blanks dropped   |
| `approximate_location` | no       | At most 120 characters                                           |
| `phone`                | no       | At most 32 characters                                            |

**201**

```json
{
  "user": {
    "id": "7c0c1bfb-acf5-48ad-a3ba-4ea6617e05d8",
    "email": "ada@example.com",
    "display_name": "Ada Lovelace",
    "preferred_languages": ["en", "fr"],
    "approximate_location": "Cape Town",
    "phone": "+27000000000",
    "created_at": "2026-10-07T18:26:37.134182+02:00"
  },
  "access_token": "<jwt>",
  "refresh_token": "<jwt>",
  "expires_in": 900
}
```

The response never contains a password or a password hash.

**Errors:** `400 validation_error`, `400 invalid_request`, `409 email_taken`,
`413 request_too_large`, `500 internal_error`.

## POST /auth/login

Exchanges credentials for a token pair.

**Request**

```json
{ "email": "ada@example.com", "password": "at-least-8-characters" }
```

**200** — the same shape as register.

**Errors:** `401 invalid_credentials`, `400 invalid_request`, `413 request_too_large`,
`500 internal_error`.

A wrong password and an unknown email both return `401 invalid_credentials` with an
identical message, so the endpoint cannot be used to discover which accounts exist.

## Tokens

Two HS256 JWTs are issued. Both are signed with `KNOT_JWT_SECRET`.

| Token           | Lifetime | Claims                                    |
| --------------- | -------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| `access_token`  | 15 min   | `typ=access`, `sub=<user id>`, `iat`, `exp` |
| `refresh_token` | 30 days  | `typ=refresh`, `sub`, `iat`, `exp`, `jti` (random) |

Verified claims are checked for signature, algorithm (HS256 only), expiry, and token
type, so a refresh token cannot be used as an access token. An `Authorization: Bearer`
header convention is documented here for future endpoints.

**Not yet implemented:** a refresh endpoint, logout, and any endpoint that consumes the
access token. Only issuance exists today. Removing `refresh_token`/`jti` rotation and
revocation from scope was deliberate — see KNOT-ADR-005.
